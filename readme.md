## Storyline
The Siuslaw river is a short river that runs from the Oregon coast range out to the Pacific Ocean.

It cuts through the Tyee sandstone formation and provides habitat to osprey, brown bear, salmon, and other
iconic Oregon animals.

The hills surrounding the river have been logged repeatedly in the last several decades. The hillsides are
checkered in monocrops, and there are several landslides which have occurred as a result of logging activities.

Running parallel to the river are a railroad that connects Coos Bay to Eugene, and an old stagecoach road
that was once the only road between Eugene and Florence, but has now been replaced in function by Highway 126.

The Siuslaw is an undammed river that provides summertime recreation and wintertime fishing. It is a popular
destination for local residents year round.

#### Issues
Favicon nonesense wasted two of my hours, the tutorial doesn't
work. I found an icon and downloaded it in a way that was
not included in the tutorial.

I'm basically going to copy the Cities of Oregon storymap and input my own data. If that isn't good
enough than I'm sorry but it is what it is.
